My experiments with Financial/Quantitative Analysis and Modeling

## Ideas: 
Probably trading bots and stuff with stocks, not to game anything
(probably going to ultimately stay in buy and hold, and absolutely no shorting)
but to try out all the quant modeling and stuff, and to practice algorithms, esp.
modeling, control theory, statistics, math, and machine learning (Muzero, looking
at you)

Markowitz Model is the first goal. Probably going to remain on P
side as its the thing that makes most sense to me as a buyer
